There's only one file that you have to copy the content and inject into the profile file of your operational system. Way simple, it injects custom CVT outputs to your graphics card handler in the OS. 

It works with most distros, it means what you'll be able to use with Debian, Mint, and so.

## How to use

Copy the content of upscaller.sh and paste it to the end of the file ~/.profile
